10:00 I spoke with Mike on the phone. His supposed to be off but he will come in shortly to review the status of the ASEGRM and ASDEV.  Neither is responding to TNSPING.

Worked with Mike and Brad to bring up ASEGRM.  Listener was down.  Port was down and had to be plumbed.

Spent some time working on Brad's documentation of the various systems here using Access.
q
4/12/11  7:50 AM   Checking status of all databases.  PDB2 is down.  STBDB1, STBDB2, STBDB4 have no listener response.   STBDB4, STBPDB returned invalid username/password.   Sent email to Brad and Faye.  Sent txt message to Brad's phone.
Resolution PDB2 is always down. STBDB1,2 and 4 are Data Guard standby and use the ETADBx password.

Checked on space issues.  prodora08 has a couple of mnt pts that are above 85%.

Additionally there are 300GB on /u02/oradata/dev. As it is in a development environment >perhaps< we could ask the developers if they could delete some records. The largest files are:

reviewed crontab scripts that backup databases.

analized historyical data I collected on space usage in the root directory of PRODORA08.  It showed dramatic swings and I made an Excell spreadsheet chart and showed it to Mike.  I proposed gathering data on the log and data directories and he agreed.  Next Tuesday is my last day so I'll set up the collection and terminate it Tuesday.  Perhaps I'll be extened and will be able to extend the study.

Filed SRC requesting help with creating PMTEST database
left early

10:11 5/6/2011
reviewed email and output logs and found no urgent issues
continued review or crontab backup scripts
determined statement that submits RMAN command
submitted weekly status report.
looking into prodora07 etadb4 errors for Mike.  I'm not able to make sence of it.  I can't find the trc files it says it is writing.
Closed the Service Request.  Faying didn't persue it.  Instead she cloned and existing database and cleaned it out to use for this purpose.


13:09 5/9/2011
checked into PRODORA06, 07 and 08.  They weren't too bad and I didn't see any files to safely delete.  I left it for Mike and Fay to deal with.  OAStest02 is not responding to browsers.  I established the host was up but I don't have password access to the oracle user on that machine so I waited for Mike.  Turns out the server went down over the weekend and the webserver didn't come back up.

Explored shell commands to find large files:  du .|sort -k1 -nr| head -n 5

etadb3 threw errors from export.  snapshot too old.  instance up and generating arclogs like crazy
