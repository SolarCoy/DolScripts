\a : an ASCII bell character (07)
\d : the date in "Weekday Month Date" format (e.g., "Tue May 26")
\D{format} :	the format is passed to strftime(3) and the result is inserted into the prompt string; an empty format results in a locale-specific time representation. The braces are required
\e : an ASCII escape character (033)
\h : the hostname up to the first '.'
\H : the hostname
\j : the number of jobs currently managed by the shell
\l : the basename of the shell’s terminal device name
\n : newline
\r : carriage return
\s : the name of the shell, the basename of $0 (the portion following the final slash)
\t : the current time in 24-hour HH:MM:SS format
\T : the current time in 12-hour HH:MM:SS format
\@ : the current time in 12-hour am/pm format
\A : the current time in 24-hour HH:MM format
\u : the username of the current user
\v : the version of bash (e.g., 2.00)
\V : the release of bash, version + patch level (e.g., 2.00.0)
\w : the current working directory, with $HOME abbreviated with a tilde
\W : the basename of the current working directory, with $HOME abbreviated with a tilde
\! : the history number of this command
\# : the command number of this command
\$ : if the effective UID is 0, a #, otherwise a $
\nnn : the character corresponding to the octal number nnn
\\ : a backslash
\[ : begin a sequence of non-printing characters, which could be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the prompt
\] : end a sequence of non-printing characters

 -x    When evaluating file sizes, evaluate only those  files
           that have the same device as the file specified by the
           file operand.

-a    In addition to the default output, report the size  of
           each  file not of type directory in the file hierarchy
           rooted in the specified file. Regardless of the  pres-
           ence  of  the -a option, non-directories given as file
           operands will always be listed.
  -h    All sizes are scaled to a human readable  format,  for
           example,  14K, 234M, 2.7G, or 3.0T. Scaling is done by
           repetitively dividing by 1024.

 -s    Instead of the default output, report only  the  total
           sum for each of the specified files.

The following options are supported for /usr/bin/du only:
-d    Do not cross filesystem boundaries. For example, du -d
           / reports usage only on the root partition.

     -L    Process symbolic links by using the file or  directory
           which  the  symbolic  link references, rather than the
           link itself.

H="host name"
hostname



H="uname system information"
uname
     The following options are supported:

     -a    Prints basic information currently available from  the
           system.

     -i    Prints the name of the hardware implementation  (plat-
           form).

     -m    Prints the machine hardware name (class). Use of  this
           option is discouraged; use uname -p instead. See NOTES
           section below.

     -n    Prints the nodename (the nodename is the name by which
           the system is known to a communications network).

     -p    Prints the current host's ISA or processor type.

     -r    Prints the operating system release level.

     -s    Prints the name of the operating system. This  is  the
           default.

     -S system_name
           The nodename may be changed  by  specifying  a  system
           name  argument. The system name argument is restricted
           to SYS_NMLN characters. SYS_NMLN is an  implementation
           specific  value  defined  in <sys/utsname.h>. Only the
           super-user is allowed  this  capability.  This  change
           does  not  persist  across  reboots of the system. Use
           sys-unconfig(1M) to change a host's name permanently.

     -v    Prints the operating system version.

     -X    Prints expanded system  information,  one  information
           element  per  line,  as  expected  by  SCO  UNIX.  The
           displayed information includes:

              o  system name, node,  release,  version,  machine,
                 and number of CPUs.

              o  BusType, Serial, and Users (set to "unknown"  in
                 Solaris)

              o  OEM# and Origin# (set to 0 and 1, respectively)
