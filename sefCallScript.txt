 -x    When evaluating file sizes, evaluate only those  files
           that have the same device as the file specified by the
           file operand.

-a    In addition to the default output, report the size  of
           each  file not of type directory in the file hierarchy
           rooted in the specified file. Regardless of the  pres-
           ence  of  the -a option, non-directories given as file
           operands will always be listed.
  -h    All sizes are scaled to a human readable  format,  for
           example,  14K, 234M, 2.7G, or 3.0T. Scaling is done by
           repetitively dividing by 1024.

 -s    Instead of the default output, report only  the  total
           sum for each of the specified files.

The following options are supported for /usr/bin/du only:
-d    Do not cross filesystem boundaries. For example, du -d
           / reports usage only on the root partition.

     -L    Process symbolic links by using the file or  directory
           which  the  symbolic  link references, rather than the
           link itself.
